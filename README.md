# EEG-VR-TouchDesigner
A project I did for Birmingham Arts Science Festival prototying a VR experience you could control with your mind via EEG signals.

In the VR experience the user can control the visuals by concentrating or meditating. The more the user relaxed the calmer the visuals were. This could potentially be used as a meditation experience - although the prototyping was really just an experiment in alterative interfaces for VR, exploring the concept of an outbody experience in which you did not need to use your body to interact with(in the sense of controllers or hand movement)

The project uses: 
- a Muse Head Band 
- TouchDesigner for live prototyping in VR
- An Oculus Rift
- Muse Monitor App

The Muse interacts with TouchDesigner via OSC sent via the Muse Monitor App.
